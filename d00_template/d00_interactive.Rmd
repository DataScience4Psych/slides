# Your Turn

.your-turn[
- On Github, download the assignment called `AE01a - UN Votes`.
- In the Files pane in the bottom right corner, spot the file called `unvotes.Rmd`. Open it, and then click on the "Knit" button.
- Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- we'll talk about what this means later) and knit again.
- Change the country names to those you're interested in. Your spelling and capitalization should match how the countries appear in the data, so take a peek at the Appendix to confirm spelling. Knit again. Voila, your first data visualization!

# Question Slide

.question[
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
]

--

Near-term goals:

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)

--

Long-term goals:

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

# Tip Slide

.tip[
When working in an R Markdown document, your analysis is re-run each time you knit. If web scraping in an R Markdown document, you'd be re-scraping the data each time you knit, which is undesirable (and not *nice*)!

An alternative workflow: 
- Use an R script to save your code 
- Save interim data scraped using the code in the script as CSV or RDS files
- Use the saved data in your analysis in your R Markdown document

# Discussion

.large[
Let's discuss the ethical implications of data science.
]

Consider these questions:
1. What responsibilities do data scientists have?
2. How can we ensure privacy in the age of big data?
3. What are potential negative consequences of data-driven decision making?

We'll break into small groups for 10 minutes, then come back for a full-class discussion.
