# Simple Code Chunk

Here's a simple R code chunk:


``` r
x &lt;- 3 * 4
y &lt;- 10 - 2
z &lt;- x + y
print(z)
```

```
## [1] 20
```

---

# Code with Output

This code chunk will show both the code and its output:


``` r
# Create a vector
numbers &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Calculate mean and standard deviation
mean_value &lt;- mean(numbers)
sd_value &lt;- sd(numbers)

# Print results
cat("Mean:", mean_value, "\n")
```

```
## Mean: 3
```

``` r
cat("Standard Deviation:", sd_value)
```

```
## Standard Deviation: 1.581139
```

---

# Code with Highlighted Lines

In this example, we'll highlight important lines:


``` r
# Load the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# Create a simple dataframe
df &lt;- tibble(
  x = 1:5,
  y = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
)

# Plot the data
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

![](d00_code_files/figure-html/highlight-lines-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Data Visualization Code

Here's an example of creating a data visualization with code:


``` r
conflicts_prefer(palmerpenguins::penguins,.quiet = TRUE)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7,na.rm=TRUE ) +
  labs(title = "Penguin Size",
       x = "Flipper Length (mm)",
       y = "Body Mass (g)",
       color = "Species") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](d00_code_files/figure-html/data-viz-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Data Manipulation

This slide demonstrates data manipulation with dplyr:


``` r
penguins %&gt;%
  group_by(species, island) %&gt;%
  summarize(
    mean_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(mean_body_mass))
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'species'. You can override
## using the `.groups` argument.
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 4
## # Groups:   species [3]
##   species   island    mean_body_mass mean_flipper_length
##   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Gentoo    Biscoe             5076.                217.
## 2 Chinstrap Dream              3733.                196.
## 3 Adelie    Biscoe             3710.                189.
## 4 Adelie    Torgersen          3706.                191.
## 5 Adelie    Dream              3688.                190.
```

# Interactive Code Output

This slide shows how to create an interactive table:


``` r
library(DT)

penguins %&gt;%
  select(species, island, body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm) %&gt;%
  datatable()
```

# Statistical Analysis

This slide demonstrates a simple statistical test:

# Print the results
print(t_test_result)
```

```

## 
## data:  flipper_length_mm by sex
## t = -4.8079, df = 325.28, p-value = 2.336e-06
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group female and group male is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -10.064811  -4.219821
