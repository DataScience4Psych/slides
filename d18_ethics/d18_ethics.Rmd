## Original study
<br>
Moore, Steven C., et al. **["Association of leisure-time physical activity with risk of 26 types of cancer in 1.44 million adults."](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2521826)** JAMA internal medicine 176.6 (2016): 816-825.

- **Volunteers** were **asked** about their physical activity level over the preceding year. 
- Half exercised less than about 150 minutes per week, half exercised more. 
- Compared to the bottom 10% of exercisers, the top 10% had lower rates of esophageal, liver, lung, endometrial, colon, and breast cancer.
- Researchers found no association between exercising and 13 other cancers (e.g. pancreatic, ovarian, and brain).

## OK Cupid data breach

- In 2016, researchers published data of 70,000 OkCupid users—including usernames, political leanings, drug usage, and intimate sexual details

- Researchers didn't release the real names and pictures of OKCupid users, but their identities could easily be uncovered from the details provided, e.g. usernames
