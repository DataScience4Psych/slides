# Communicating data science results effectively

# Five core activities of data science

1. Stating and refining the question
1. Exploring the data
1. Building formal statistical models
1. Interpreting the results
1. Communicating the results

# Stating and refining the question

---

## Six types of questions

1. **Descriptive:** summarize a characteristic of a set of data
1. **Exploratory:** analyze to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables (hypothesis generating)
1. **Inferential:** analyze patterns, trends, or relationships in representative data from a population
1. **Predictive:** make predictions for individuals or groups of individuals
1. **Causal:** whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average, in a population
1. **Mechanistic:** explore "how" as opposed to whether

## Ex: COVID-19 and Vitamin D

1. **Descriptive:** frequency of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 in a set of data collected from a group of individuals
--

1. **Exploratory:** examine relationships between a range of dietary factors and COVID-19 hospitalizations
--

1. **Inferential:** examine whether any relationship between taking Vitamin D supplements and COVID-19 hospitalizations found in the sample hold for the population at large

--
1. **Predictive:** what types of people will take Vitamin D supplements during the next year

--
1. **Causal:** whether people with COVID-19 who were randomly assigned to take Vitamin D supplements or those who were not are hospitalized

--
1. **Mechanistic:** how increased vitamin D intake leads to a reduction in the number of viral illnesses

## Questions to data science problems

- Do you have appropriate data to answer your question?
- Do you have information on confounding variables?
- Was the data you're working with collected in a way that introduces bias?

--
.pull-left[
.question[
- Suppose I want to estimate the average number of children in households in Winston-Salem. 
- I conduct a survey at an elementary school in Winston-Salem and ask those students: 
  - how many children, including themselves, live in their house.
- Then, I take the average of the responses. 
]
]

--
.pull-right[
.question[
- Is this a biased or an unbiased estimate of the number of children in households in Winston-Salem? 
- If biased, will the value be an overestimate or underestimate?
]

# Exploratory data analysis

---

## Checklist

- Formulate your question
- Read in your data
- Check the dimensions
- Look at the top and the bottom of your data
- Validate with at least one external data source
- Make a plot
- Try the easy solution first

---

## Formulate your question

- Consider scope:
  - Are air pollution levels higher on the east coast than on the west coast?
  - Are hourly ozone levels on average higher in New York City than they are in Los Angeles?
  - Do counties in the eastern United States have higher ozone levels than counties in the western United States?
- Most importantly: "Do I have the right data to answer this question?"

---

## Read in your data

- Place your data in a folder called `data`
- Read it into R with `read_csv()` or friends (`read_delim()`, `read_excel()`, etc.)

```{r}
library(readxl)
fav_food <- read_excel("data/favorite-food.xlsx")
fav_food
```

---

## `clean_names()`

If the variable names are malformatted, use `janitor::clean_names()`

.small[
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(janitor)
fav_food %>% clean_names()  
```
]

# Case study: NYC Squirrels!

---

## NYC Squirrels!

- [The Squirrel Census](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/) is a multimedia science, design, and storytelling project focusing on the Eastern gray (*Sciurus carolinensis*). They count squirrels and present their findings to the public.
- This table contains squirrel data for each of the 3,023 sightings, including location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans.

```{r}
#install_github("mine-cetinkaya-rundel/nycsquirrels18")
library(nycsquirrels18)
```

---

## Locate the codebook

[mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/nycsquirrels18/reference/squirrels.html](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/nycsquirrels18/reference/squirrels.html)

<br><br>

--

## Check the dimensions

```{r}
dim(squirrels)
```

---

## Look at the top...

.midi[
```{r}
squirrels %>% head()
```
]

---

## ...and the bottom

.midi[
```{r}
squirrels %>% tail()
```
]

---

## Validate with at least one external data source

.medi[.pull-left-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE}
squirrels %>%
  select(long, lat) %>%
  print(n = 15)
```
]
]
.pull-right-wide[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/central-park-coords.png")
```
]

---

## Make a plot

.medi[.pull-right[
```{r sq-plot1, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(squirrels, aes(x = long, y = lat)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```
]
]
.pull-left-wide[
```{r ref.label="sq-plot1", echo = FALSE,out.width="90%"}
```
]


--

.pull-left-narrow[
**Hypothesis:** Squirrel sightings will have a higher density on the perimeter than inside the park.
]
---

## Try the easy solution first

.small[
.pull-right-narrow[
```{r easy-solution, fig.show = "hide"}
squirrels <- squirrels %>%
  separate(hectare, 
           into = c("NS", "EW"), 
           sep = 2, remove = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(where = 
        if_else(NS %in% c("01", "42") | 
                 EW %in% c("A", "I"),
                      "perimeter",
                      "inside")) 

ggplot(squirrels, aes(x = long, y = lat,
                      color = where)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```						  
]
]
.pull-left-wide[
```{r ref.label="easy-solution", echo =FALSE, out.width = "90%"}
```
]
					   
---

## Then go deeper...

.medi[.pull-left[
```{r hex-plot1, fig.show = "hide"}
hectare_counts <- squirrels %>%
  group_by(hectare) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) 

hectare_centroids <- squirrels %>%
  group_by(hectare) %>%
  summarize(
    centroid_x = mean(long),
    centroid_y = mean(lat))

squirrels %>%
  left_join(hectare_counts,
            by = "hectare") %>%
  left_join(hectare_centroids,
            by = "hectare") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = centroid_x, 
             y = centroid_y, 
             color = n)) +
  geom_hex()
```
]		
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="hex-plot1",out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
```
]
---

```{r eval=FALSE}
hectare_counts <- squirrels %>%
  group_by(hectare) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) 

hectare_centroids <- squirrels %>%
  group_by(hectare) %>%
  summarize(
    centroid_x = mean(long),
    centroid_y = mean(lat)
  )

squirrels %>%
  left_join(hectare_counts, by = "hectare") %>%
  left_join(hectare_centroids, by = "hectare") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = centroid_x, y = centroid_y, color = n)) +
  geom_hex()
```

---

## The squirrel is staring at me!

.medi[
```{r}
squirrels %>%
  filter(str_detect(other_interactions, "star")) %>%
  select(shift, age, other_interactions)
```
]

---

## Communicating for your audience
.pull-left-narrow[
- Avoid: 
  - jargon, 
  - uninterpreted results, 
  - lengthy output
- Pay attention to: 
  - organization, 
  - presentation, 
  - flow
]

.pull-right-wide[
- Don't forget about: 
  - code style, 
  - coding best practices, 
  - meaningful commits
- Be open to: 
  - suggestions, 
    - feedback, 
    - taking (calculated) risks
