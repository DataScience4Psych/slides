## Shiny

.pull-left[
- Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R
- You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards
- You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions
- Learn more at [shiny.rstudio.com](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

## High level view

- Every Shiny app has a webpage that the user visits, and behind this webpage there is a computer that serves this webpage by running R
- When running your app locally, the computer serving your app is your computer
- When your app is deployed, the computer serving your app is a web server

## Anatomy of a Shiny app

- User interface
  - controls the layout and appearance of app
- Server function 
  - contains instructions needed to build app
  
```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE }
library(shiny)
# User interface 
ui <- fluidPage()

# Server function 
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```
