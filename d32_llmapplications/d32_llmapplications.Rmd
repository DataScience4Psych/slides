# 1. Text Understanding and Analysis

---

## Text Understanding and Analysis

- Extract insights from text data
- Applications:
  - Text classification
  - Named entity recognition
  - Text similarity and clustering
  - Anomaly detection

---

## Text Classification 

- Categorize text into predefined classes
- Applications:
  - Sentiment analysis 
  - Topic classification
  - Intent detection in chatbots
- Fine-tuned LLMs like BERT achieve state-of-the-art results
  - [Tensorflow has really solid tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/classify_text_with_bert)

---

## Named Entity Recognition

- Identify and classify named entities in within unstructured text.
- Use cases:
  - Information extraction
  - Building knowledge graphs
  - Enhancing search capabilities
- Models like [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) can be fine-tuned for NER

---

## Text Similarity and Clustering

- Measure semantic similarity between texts
- Use cases:
  - Document de-duplication
  - Content recommendation systems
- Sentence transformers like [SBERT](https://sbert.net/) are effective for this

---

## Anomaly Detection in Text Data

- Identify unusual patterns or outliers in text
- Use cases:
  - Fraud detection in financial documents
  - Identifying errors in medical records
- Autoencoder architectures with LLMs can be used
- **Check out this [Paper that talks more about this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13900)**

## R Example: Text Classification (Sentiment Analysis)

.midi[
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Sample text data
texts <- c(
  "I love this product! It's amazing.",
  "This is terrible. I hate it.",
  "It's okay, nothing special.",
  "Wow, absolutely fantastic experience!",
  "Disappointed with the quality."
)

# Create a tibble
df <- tibble(text = texts)
```
]

---

## Tokenize and Perform Sentiment Analysis

.midi[
```{r}
sentiment_scores <- df %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(sentiment) %>%
  spread(sentiment, n, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(sentiment_score = positive - negative)

sentiment_scores
```
]

---

## Visualize Sentiment Analysis Results

.midi[
```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
df %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sentiment)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#0078D7", color = "black", width = 0.7) + # Darker blue bars with black borders
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18) + # Larger text for better readability
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA), # Match background color to slide
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA),
    text = element_text(color = "black"), # Match font color to slide
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray40", linewidth = 0.5), # Use `linewidth` for gridline thickness
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "gray70", linewidth = 0.25)  # Use `linewidth` for minor gridlines
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Overall Vibes",
    x = "",
    y = "Count"
  )

    next_word_options <- markov_chain %>%
      filter(word == current_word) %>%
      pull(next_words) %>%
      unlist()
    
    if (length(next_word_options) == 0) break
    
    next_word <- sample(next_word_options, 1)

library(dplyr)

context <- "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. 
It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the Tower."

question <- "Who designed the Eiffel Tower?"

# Tokenize context and question
context_tokens <- tibble(text = context) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

question_tokens <- tibble(text = question) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

# Simple word overlap for demonstration
matching_words <- intersect(context_tokens$word, question_tokens$word)

# Find sentence with most matching words
sentences <- tibble(text = context) %>%
  unnest_tokens(sentence, text, token = "sentences")

best_sentence <- sentences %>%
  mutate(matches = sapply(sentence, function(s) {
    sum(matching_words %in% unlist(strsplit(s, " ")))
  })) %>%
  arrange(desc(matches)) %>%
  slice(1)

print(best_sentence$sentence)
```

# Question Answering with R: A Breakdown

---

## Step 1: Setup

.pull-left-wide[.midi[
```{r}
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)

context <- "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower."

question <- "Who designed the Eiffel Tower?"
```
]]
.pull-right-narrow[
- Load necessary libraries
- Define the context (text containing the answer)
- Define the question we want to answer
]

---

## Step 2: Tokenization

.pull-left.midi[
```{r}
context_tokens <- tibble(text = context) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

(question_tokens <- tibble(text = question) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text))
```
]
.pull-right[
- Break down context and question into individual words (tokens)
- `unnest_tokens()` from `tidytext` package does the heavy lifting
- Result: Two data frames with one word per row
]

---

## Step 3: Word Matching

.pull-left[
```{r}
matching_words <- intersect(
  context_tokens$word, 
  question_tokens$word
)
```
]
.pull-right[
- Find words that appear in both context and question
- `intersect()` function identifies common words
- This helps focus on potentially relevant parts of the context
]

---

## Step 4: Sentence Splitting


```{r}
sentences <- tibble(text = context) %>%
  unnest_tokens(sentence,
                text,
                token = "sentences")
```

--

- Split the context into individual sentences
- Again using `unnest_tokens()`, but with `token = "sentences"`
- Prepares for sentence-level analysis



---

## Step 5: Answer Extraction (Part 1)


```{r}
best_sentence <- sentences %>%
  mutate(matches = sapply(sentence, function(s) {
    sum(matching_words %in% unlist(strsplit(s, " ")))
  }))
```

--

- Count matching words in each sentence
- `sapply()` applies the counting function to each sentence
- Creates a new column 'matches' with the count


---

## Step 5: Answer Extraction (Part 2)

.pull-left[
```{r}
best_sentence <- best_sentence %>%
  arrange(desc(matches)) %>%
  slice(1)
```
]

.pull-right[
- Rank sentences by number of matching words
- `arrange(desc(matches))` sorts in descending order
- `slice(1)` selects the top-ranked sentence
]

---

## Step 6: Result Output


.pull-left[
- Print the sentence most likely to contain the answer
- This sentence has the most word overlap with the question
- A simple but effective approach for basic question answering
]


.pull-right[
```{r}
print(best_sentence$sentence)
```
]
