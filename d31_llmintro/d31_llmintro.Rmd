# How LLMs Work: Core Concepts

---


## The Core Concept: Next-Token Prediction

pull-left[
**The fundamental task:**
- Given a sequence of words, predict what comes next
- Example:
  - Input: "The capital of France is"
  - Prediction: "Paris" (with high confidence)

**Learning approach:**
- From explicit rules to learning patterns
- Self-supervised learning from vast text corpora
]

.pull-right[
**This simple objective leads to:**
- Understanding of grammar and syntax
- Acquisition of factual knowledge
- Reasoning capabilities
- Contextual awareness

.question[
How can this seemingly simple prediction task lead to such sophisticated language abilities?
]

.pull-right[
**This simple task leads to:**
- Grammar understanding
- Factual knowledge
- Reasoning capabilities
- Context awareness

.question[
How can this single objective (next-word prediction) lead to such versatile abilities?
]
]

---

## How LLMs Process Language

.pull-left[
- LLMs don't process raw text directly
- Text is split into "tokens"
  - Words, subwords, or characters
  - Example: "psychology" → ["psycho", "logy"]
- Different models use different tokenization methods
  - GPT models: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)
  - BERT: WordPiece
]

.pull-right[
- Tokens converted to vector representations
- Context window limits how much text can be processed
  - GPT-3.5: ~4,000 tokens
  - GPT-4: 8,000-32,000 tokens
  - Claude: Up to 100,000 tokens
- Models predict tokens based on previous tokens

# Architecture of LLMs

.pull-left[
Key components:
- **Transformer architecture**
  - Neural network design specialized for sequential data
  - Introduced in "Attention is All You Need" (2017)
  - Processes entire sequences at once, not one-by-one
  - Stacks of identical layers that transform data
- Self-attention mechanism
- Positional encoding
- Layer normalization
- Feed-forward neural networks

# LLM Training Process

## LLM Training: Three-Stage Process

.pull-left[
1. **Pre-training**
   - Self-supervised learning on massive text corpus
   - Learns statistical patterns in language

2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**
   - Human-labeled examples of desired outputs
   - Aligns with human instructions

3. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**
   - Human preferences used to refine model
   - Rewards helpful, truthful, harmless outputs
]

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%",error=TRUE}
# This would be an image showing the three-stage training process
knitr::include_graphics("img/llm-training-stages.png")
```
]

---

## Pre-training: Learning from Data

.pull-left[
**Training objective:**
- Next token prediction
- Model learns to predict what comes next in a sequence
- Example: "The capital of France is ___" → "Paris"

**Data sources:**
- Books, articles, websites
- Social media, forums
- Code repositories
- Wikipedia
- Scientific literature
]

.pull-right[
**Scale:**
- Hundreds of billions to trillions of tokens
- GPT-3: 300B tokens
- PaLM: 780B tokens
- GPT-4: Estimated trillions of tokens

**Computational requirements:**
- Thousands of GPUs/TPUs
- Weeks to months of training time
- Massive energy consumption
  - GPT-3: ~1,287 MWh (equivalent to 120+ US homes' annual usage)
]

---

## Fine-tuning: Aligning with Human Intent

.pull-left[
**Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):**
- Human-written examples of desired outputs
- Model learns to follow instructions
- Much smaller dataset than pre-training
  - Thousands to millions of examples
]

.pull-right[
**Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):**
1. Generate multiple responses to prompts
2. Human labelers rank responses by quality
3. Train reward model on these preferences
4. Use reinforcement learning to optimize model against reward function

**Result:** More helpful, accurate, and safe outputs
]

## Challenges in LLM Training

- **Catastrophic forgetting**
  - Model loses previously learned knowledge during fine-tuning
  - Addressed through careful parameter updates
- **Reward hacking**
  - Model optimizes for reward signals rather than true intentions
  - Requires robust reward modeling
- **Data contamination**
  - Test datasets appearing in training data
  - Inflated benchmark performance
- **Evaluation methods**
  - Perplexity (how well model predicts text)
  - Benchmark datasets (MMLU, HumanEval, TruthfulQA)
  - Human evaluations and red teaming
